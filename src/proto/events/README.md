# Events proto files

Contains all our event contracts for example `UserCreatedEvent` etc to be langauge agnostic and be listen to and be used 
across multiple langauges


## Style guide 

- File Contains scope of a model for example `user_events.proto` contaisn all user related events
- Events are names `IdentiferEvent` with event on the end of it for example `UserCreatedEvent`
- Each file ends in `Identifer_Events`
