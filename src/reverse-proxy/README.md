Yes, you can scope the installation of `jinja2` to a specific directory or project by using a **virtual environment**. This is a good practice because it keeps your dependencies isolated from the global Python environment.

Hereâ€™s how you can install `jinja2` in a specific directory:

### **1. Create a Virtual Environment**

Navigate to your project directory (e.g., `C:\dev\PoliceCaseManagement\src\reverse-proxy`) and create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

This will create a directory called `venv` that will contain a separate Python environment for your project.

### **2. Activate the Virtual Environment**

* On **Windows**, run:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

* On **macOS/Linux**, run:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should now see `(venv)` in your terminal, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

### **3. Install Jinja2 in the Virtual Environment**

Now, with the virtual environment active, you can install `jinja2`:

```bash
pip install jinja2
```

This will install `jinja2` only in the virtual environment, isolating it from the global Python environment.

### **4. Run Your Script**

After installing `jinja2`, run your script as usual:

```bash
python .\generate_nginx_conf.py
```

### **5. Deactivate the Virtual Environment**

Once you're done working, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply running:

```bash
deactivate
```

This will return you to the global Python environment.
